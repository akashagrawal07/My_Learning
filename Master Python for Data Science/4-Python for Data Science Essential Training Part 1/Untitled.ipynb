Of course, I know the usual mumbo-jumbo about wearables and IoT-connected fitness trackers.

Mat.se automatically handles the payment, grocery selection, delivery, and delivery scheduling. Since your car is IoT-enabled, Mat.se issues its trusted delivery agent a 1-time token to use for opening your car in order to place your groceries in your car for you at 4:40 pm (just before you get off from work).\n",

Of course, I know the usual mumbo-jumbo about wearables and IoT-connected fitness trackers.
