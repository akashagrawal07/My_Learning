Mean - Average 

Median - middle point (half number of left might be smaller and right side might be larger

Calculating Standard Deviation


Formula = SquareRoot(  (Sigma(xi - xb)powerto2)/N-1   )

Mean = Xb = 8
Sample Size = N = 4

SD = SquareRoot ((Sigma(xi-8)powerto2)/4-1)  --> Expand to -->   SquareRoot (((2-8)pto2 + (8-8)pto2 + (10-8)pto2 + (12-8)pto2)/4-1) 
  = SquareRoot(18.7) = 4.32

Z Score
A data point's distance , in standard deviation ,from the mean

Z Score = (Xi -Xb)/S

Xi = data point
xb = mean
S = Standard deviation


Z Score = (Xi -Xb)/S = (231 - 139)/41 = 2.24  This means 231 is 2.24 standard deviation from mean in the positive direction

Z Score = (Xi -Xb)/S = (112 - 139)/41 = -0.66  This means 112 is 0.66 standard deviation from mean in the negative direction (112 is close to our data point)

800 - 575/75

Empirical Rule

Most of the data point in a given data set fall within 3 standard deviation of the mean


OutLiner

A data point that is an abnormal distance from the other values in the data set
